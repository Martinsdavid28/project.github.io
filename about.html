About Bitcoin

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
Bitcoin has no central point of control, as with most currencies, and is sustained by individuals<br>
in the widespread cryptocurrency community. Simply put, Bitcoin operates for the people by the people.<br>
Instead of banks, Bitcoin users visit exchanges like Bitcoin UK to buy or sell their coins. When their coins are not being used,<br>
people keep bitcoins in virtual wallets for safety.Sometimes hacks occur when bitcoins are not stored properly. The most<br>
famous example is the Mt Gox hack of 2014,when thieves stole more than 700,000 bitcoins. This was a key moment<br>in the crypto space, and has since gained near mythical status.
New bitcoins are being created every day through a process called mining. Big computers work hard to<br>
solve complicated equations, and each correct answer produces a coin. However, there is a limited number of bitcoins to be<br>
found. Once 21 million coins have been produced, we won’t be able to make anymore!<br>

<h2>What is the blockchain?</h2>
Without blockchain technology, it would be impossible to use bitcoin. The Blockchain is a secure and anonymous way<br>
to move ideas and money anywhere in the world! By recording all transactions made within the cryptocurrency network,<br>
blockchain technology removes the need for a middle-person like a bank or payment app. Moreover, the Blockchain prevents any transactions being<br>
removed, modified or tampered without permission. This creates a chain of transactions, known as blocks.
